The comments for my initial submission of MP1 were as follows:
Close! Just make sure to include your name in your headers.

I fixed this by adding a header comment to each file with my name and other
information.

Other issues that I found with my code were:
Failed some tests:
I fixed this by adding fraction-simplification code to my constructors in my 
BigFraction class. I also added a condition in toString that only returns the
numerator if the denominator of the fraction is 1.

Checkstyle errors:
I had a ton of checkstyle errors, so I fixed all of the spacing between elements,
added javadoc comments, and implemented new constants.
